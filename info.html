	<h1>About this webpage</h1>
	<hr>
	<h2>This website was produced as part of my coursework for Level 2 Digital Technologies. It shows evidence that I am
		able
		to advanced techniques to develop a website, and I can use the Design Process to develop a design.

<ul>
	<li>I have used appropriate tools and techniques for the purpose and end users. For example, I have created a
		website using
		html/css with an external stylesheet. The material is structured and formatted using a range of tags and styles.
		It has
		clear headings, body text and lists/bullets if required.</li>
	<br>
	<br>
	<li>I have applied appropriate data integrity and testing procedures.
		For example, the site has been tested/previewed either in two unrelated browsers.The text has been proof read
		and there are no obvious spelling/grammatical issues. </li>
	<br>
	<br>
	<li>I have used relevant conventions.
		For example, design elements such as contrast, repetition, alignment, proximity and white space to lay out their
		site.</li>
	<br>
	<br>
	<li>I have explained relevant implications.
		For example, I have explained why copyright should be honoured/images should be credited. I have mentioned why
		the site should be accessible for colour blind/visually impaired users. I have stated why their site should be
		easy to navigate (the site may have minor navigation issues).
	</li>
	<br>
	<br>
	<li>I can define the purpose of the digital media outcome and the requirements of the end users.</li>
	<br>
	<br>
	<li>I investigated many examples to learn about website design and current design trends. I can generate and model a
		range of design ideas. For example, I have created a series of possible site layouts. I have experimented with
		different colour, background and font options. I have sketched wireframes for the initial layout of the page
		followed by mock-ups showing various options.</li>
	<br>
	<br>
	<li>I can explain relevant implications.
		For example, I have mentioned the importance of honouring copyright and privacy (e.g. getting permission from
		students whose photos appear in the site). I have explained why the site needs to be aesthetically pleasing,
		fully functional, easy to use and accessible.</li>
